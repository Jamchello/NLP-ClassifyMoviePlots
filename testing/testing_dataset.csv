Godzilla vs. Kong,Monster,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._Kong,"Five years after Godzilla defeated King Ghidorah, Kong is monitored by Monarch within a giant dome on Skull Island. Kong is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and Kong expert Ilene Andrews' adopted daughter, who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language. Bernie Hayes, an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; during the rampage, Bernie stumbles on a massive device. Madison Russell, a fan of Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, former Monarch scientist and Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field. Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted by the U.S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong, but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs. Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishirō Serizawa, through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head, but is hobbled by its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations. Inside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they identify the power source, the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. In the ensuing mayhem, Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong battle. Godzilla is initially overpowered by Kong, but Godzilla emerges victorious. Kong loses consciousness after being defeated by Godzilla. Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. They lose control of Mechagodzilla, who kills Walter, electrocutes Ren and then attacks Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV, and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor, momentarily interrupting the mech. Godzilla supercharges Kong's axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways. Sometime later, Monarch has established an observation post in the Hollow Earth, where Kong now rules."
Raya and the Last Dragon,Animated Fantasy Action Adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raya_and_the_Last_Dragon,"The prosperous land of Kumandra is ravaged by the Druun, evil spirits that attack and petrify the land's people and dragons. Sisu, the last dragon, concentrates her magic into a gem and banishes the Druun, reviving Kumandra's people but not the dragons. A power struggle for the orb divides Kumandra's people into tribes, based on their placement along a giant, dragon-shaped river: Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail. 500 years later, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe trains his daughter, Raya, until she finally becomes a guardian of the gem. Firmly believing that the tribes can be united once again, Chief Benja decides to hold a feast for the leadership of all five tribes. During the feast, Raya befriends the daughter of Chief Virana of the Fang tribe, Namaari, who gives Raya a dragon pendant as a gift. Trusting her, Raya shows Namaari the location of the gem but Namaari, betraying Raya, reveals that she is trying to help Fang steal it. Alerted to the attack, Benja and the other tribes arrive at the scene and start fighting over the gem, which gets destroyed in the scuffle. As each tribe steals a piece of the orb, the reawakened Druun ravage Heart and its people. A wounded Chief Benja, discovering that the Druun are weak against water, throws Raya into a river before getting petrified himself. For the next six years, Raya treks across Kumandra to find Sisu in order to help her recover the missing orb pieces. After reaching a ship wreck in Tail, Raya finally manages to summon Sisu, who admits that she did not create the orb, but only used it on behalf of her siblings and can gain her siblings' powers when she touches its pieces. They recover the second piece from a booby-trapped Tail temple, granting Sisu shapeshifting powers, and encounter a hostile Namaari and her tribesmen who are after Raya's stolen portrait of Sisu. Escaping the temple, they escape on the boat of young restauranteur Boun, who lost his family to the Druun. Despite Boun's friendliness, Raya does not fully trust him, and insists that Sisu stays in human form. The group arrives at Talon to claim the third gem piece, during which Raya encounters ""con baby"" Noi and her trio of monkey-like companions, the Ongis, who adopted her after the Druun petrified her mother. After a chase, Raya recruits Noi and the Ongis while Sisu encounters Talon's chieftess, who offers her to the Druun for the other orb pieces. Raya rescues Sisu and reclaims the third piece, allowing Sisu to spew out fog which they use to escape. The group then arrives at Spine, where they meet Tong, a fearsome warrior, and the village's sole survivor. Namaari arrives and Raya holds her off in a fight so the others can escape, but before Namaari is able to defeat her, Sisu turns back into a dragon and saves Raya. Realizing that Sisu is a dragon, the companions agree to help Raya, and Tong hands over Spine’s gem piece, allowing Sisu to control rain. As the group get closer to Fang, Sisu suggests allying with Namaari rather than stealing the final piece. When Raya refuses, Sisu takes her back to the remains of the Heart and tells of how her siblings' (Pangu, Jagan, Pranee, and Amba) trust in her was what really empowered her to save Kumandra. Raya relents and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a peace offering. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari, but Namaari, torn by her responsibility to save Fang's reputation and her wish to help defeat the Druun, threatens to shoot them with a crossbow upon seeing the orb pieces. Sisu tries to calm Namaari down but is fatally shot when Raya lashes her sword on Namaari's crossbow. With the last dragon dead, and the water subsequently gone, Fang is overrun by the Druun. Raya enters to confront Namaari, whom she finds to be mourning over the petrification of her mother. The two fight while Raya's companions rescue the people of Fang using the gem pieces. Raya, besting Namaari, prepares to kill her, but stops upon realizing her fault in Sisu’s death due to her inability to trust others and heads off with Namaari to aid the group instead. As the Druun gain on Raya's group, Raya, remembering how trust allowed Sisu to save the world beforehand, urges the others to unite and reassemble the gem, showing her faith towards Namaari by handing her piece and allowing the Druun to take her. The rest follow suit, with Namaari assembling the gem before the Druun petrify her as well. With the gem reassembled, and everybody trusting each other, the Druun are vanquished and everyone, including the dragons, are revived. The dragons revive Sisu while everyone reunites with their lost loved ones, including Raya and Chief Benja. The dragons and the tribes gather at Heart to celebrate and finally reunite as Kumandra."

In a post-credits scene, Ben finds he is being charged full-price for both weddings but thinks it's a joke. Mr. Dubros though tells him that Terence crunched some numbers and it doesn't look good for him, then leaves along with Terence as Ben just stares with bewilderment."

Enmu, Lower Rank One of the Twelve Kizuki and the source of the sleep enchantment, instructs four children passengers, all suffering from severe insomnia, to enter the demon slayers' dreams and destroy their spiritual cores so that they can't wake up again. In exchange, Enmu will allow them a peaceful sleep. During their sleep, Tanjiro and his companions have happy dreams. Tanjiro in particular dreams of an alternate reality in which his family was never slain by a demon and Nezuko is still human. After the real Nezuko attempts to awaken Tanjiro with her Blood Demon Art, he realizes that he is dreaming and leaves his family. Still unable to wake up, a vision of his father instructs him to kill himself in the dream, which he manages to do by cutting his own neck.

They then resolve to utilize contacts in armored truck companies to steal millions of dollars. When they are given the Fortico heist, Jan kills the guards and Dougie against the wishes of the rest of the team. Some months later, Jackson and Tom bring the team together for a much larger but riskier final heist to steal over $150 million from the Fortico depot on Black Friday. H and Bullet are riding together when Bullet reveals he is the thieves' insider, and asks H to cooperate to avoid death. The thieves, dressed in full body armor, hide in the truck to gain access into the depot and begin taking hostages, including Terry and Dave. One worker triggers the alarm and the workers behind the weapons desk begin shooting at the thieves, but are easily dispatched. H chokes Carlos and takes his body armor to fight back, inspiring Dave to do the same while Terry hides. Realizing they may not make it out, Bullet breaks his cover and kills Dave, Dana, and the remaining guards and shoots H. Bullet, Jackson, and Jan are the only ones to make it out of the depot, though Jackson is critically wounded. They evade police and make it to a garage where they have access to underground tunnels. Believing Jan will try to kill them, Jackson takes out a pistol, but Jan stops him and slits his throat. When Jan and Bullet make it to the end of the tunnel, Bullet takes out a gun to try to kill Jan, but Jan kills him first. Jan successfully makes away with all the money before the police can deduce what happened. At Jan's apartment, he finds a phone ringing in one of the money bags, which was planted there by H to track his location. H confronts Jan with Dougie's autopsy before shooting him in the same places Dougie was shot, killing him. H turns in the money to his FBI contact and drives off with one of his associates."
The Unholy,supernatural horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unholy_(2021_film),"The film opens with the execution of a woman accused of witchcraft in 1845 in Banfield, Massachusetts. Before she dies, however, her spirit is bound to the body of a doll. Many years later, skeptical journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things strange and unusual. His latest assignment takes him to Boston, where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. As he's preparing to leave he discovers the doll shown earlier in the movie and purposely crushes it, accidentally setting the woman's spirit free. Gerry later gets into an accident as he's driving away after seeing a young girl, Alice, run across the road. He follows her to a tree, the site where he found the doll, and hears her speak before collapsing. When he takes her to a hospital later he learns that Alice is a deaf-mute and couldn't have spoken. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story rather than a hoax or prank. The following day Alice stuns the community by speaking and proclaiming that she has been cured by the Virgin Mary. This launches a media furor that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice, during which time he learns that while she has been speaking to a being named Mary, the girl has only assumed that this is the religious figure. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of ""Mary"" as a horrific entity, Gerry finds a partner in Father Hagan, who was healed by Alice but also suspects the healings' true nature. Father Hagan discovers papers detailing the death of Mary Elnor, the woman from the prologue. Mary sold her soul to Satan in order to gain eternal life and power. He would allow her and her descendants, revealed to be Alice, to perform ""miracles"" so people would pledge themselves to her and in turn, Satan. To the horror of Gerry and Father Hagan, they learn that Alice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold a service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. An attempt by Father Hagan to stop this from happening is unsuccessful and results in Mary attacking and hanging him in the church. Once the service begins Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging. Along with a physician who treated Alice earlier in the film, Gerry reveals that none of the miracles are real, as they were all a result of the placebo effect. This causes Mary to angrily appear and kill Bishop Gyles before trying to kill Gerry. She is stopped by Alice, who sacrifices herself to save his life. This in turn causes Mary to disappear, as Alice was her link to the living world. Struck by her sacrifice, Gerry begs God to save Alice's life. She comes back to life, but is once again a deaf-mute. In the epilogue, the statue of Mary inside the Church where Alice was seen praying before during the beginning of the movie cries tears of blood once again."
